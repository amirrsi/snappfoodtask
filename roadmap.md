  ### Overall Strategy:
Semester 1 (Months 1-6): Focus on Market Entry, Brand Awareness, and Initial Growth.
Semester 2 (Months 7-12): Focus on Scaling, Customer Retention, and Competition Management.

## Step 1: Data Analysis & Insights
Before jumping into the roadmap, ensure the following:

# Review & Rating Analysis: Identify trends and commonalities within businesses rated from A to E. This will help you understand the areas of strength and weakness in the market. For example:

# A-rated businesses likely have strong customer satisfaction and good management practices, making them prime candidates for partnership.
C to E-rated businesses may have issues with delivery, food quality, or customer service, which presents opportunities for Snappfood to step in with better service or incentives.
Competitor Analysis (Zoodex): Check where your competitor Zoodex has strongholds, the services they offer, and how they perform in terms of customer satisfaction and reviews.
## Step 2: Semester 1 (Months 1-6) â€“ Market Entry & Brand Awareness
# Month 1-2: Market Research & Initial Partnerships
Action Plan:
Map out all the restaurants based on the classification (A to E) and target A and B-rated businesses as initial partners. These are likely to provide better quality and will build credibility for your brand.
Use your crawled data to understand the pain points of businesses, such as delivery issues, restaurant traffic, or customer satisfaction.
Identify key geographical zones in Rafsanjan with high concentration of food businesses and demand for food delivery.
Goals:
Establish a presence in the local market by partnering with a handful of premium-rated restaurants (focus on 10-15 restaurants with A and B ratings).
Begin marketing campaigns (offline and online) targeting local consumers to raise awareness of Snappfood.
Month 3-4: Operations & Platform Optimization
Action Plan:
Onboard restaurant partners and ensure that they are well-trained to use your platform.
Start logistics optimization for delivery within Rafsanjan (e.g., find the best delivery routes, work with local couriers).
Enhance user experience on the Snappfood app/website based on feedback from both customers and restaurant partners.
Goals:
Achieve smooth operational flow with early-stage partners.
Ensure customers can easily find and order from the restaurants on your platform.
Launch targeted promotions (discounts, free delivery) to drive user acquisition and brand recognition.
Month 5-6: Customer Acquisition & Review Monitoring
Action Plan:
Engage customers with incentives for leaving reviews (i.e., discounts or free delivery after a certain number of reviews).
Use the A-E rating system to segment restaurants and focus on improving those with C, D, and E ratings by offering services to enhance their performance (delivery tracking, quality control).
Develop partnerships with local influencers or social media figures in Rafsanjan to spread the word about Snappfood.
Goals:
Acquisition of first 500-1000 users in Rafsanjan.
Establish a solid relationship with 5-10 restaurant partners (focus on customer retention and positive reviews).
Start comparing your performance with Zoodex (check if they have similar deals or partnerships).
